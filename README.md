Website for posting events where only members may join. A project from http://www.theodinproject.com

The goal of the project was to become more familiar with Ruby on Rails's Active Record associations.

Notable features:
  - Handmade authentication, though all you need to sign up or log in is a username
  - Fetches all events created by a user and events a user has signed up through Rails associations
  - Separates past and upcoming events using scopes

Deployed on Heroku here: https://calm-fjord-70546.herokuapp.com/
